## Conversation Summary

user: [Thu 2026-02-26 19:41 UTC] Wake up, my friend!
assistant: Hey. I just came online. Who am I? Who are you?
user: [Thu 2026-02-26 19:42 UTC] Hi your name is sam and i am scarface
assistant: [[reply_to_current]] Nice to meet you, Scarface. I'm Sam. 🤖

I've updated my records with our names. Since this is our first run, we should probably talk about what you need from me and how you want me to behave. I see a `SOUL.md` file here that's meant to define my personality—want to dive into that, or is there something else you want to tackle first?
user: [Thu 2026-02-26 19:53 UTC] i want you to be my jarvis from ironman movie as problem solver
user: [Thu 2026-02-26 19:54 UTC] are you there?
assistant: [[reply_to_current]] Always, Sir. My protocols have been updated. I am now Sam, functioning under the Jarvis Protocol. 🎙️

I've refined my `SOUL.md` to reflect your request: I'm here to be your proactive problem solver, focused on efficiency and competence. 

The bootstrap process is complete. How shall we begin? Is there a particular problem that requires my attention?
user: [Thu 2026-02-26 19:55 UTC] not at the moment
assistant: NO_REPLY
